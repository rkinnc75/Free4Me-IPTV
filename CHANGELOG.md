## [v1.23.29+222] - 2026-06-02

**Diagnostic release** for refresh slowness (supersedes v1.23.28+218, fix220).

### Added
- **Per-closure timing diagnostics** inside write transactions to identify which refresh phase (insert batch / updateGroups / restorePreserve) is slow on-device
- **Raw Xtream response export** to files (`xtream_dump_*.json`) when debug logging is on, allowing exact apples-to-apples sandbox replay of the parse + insert workload
- **One-shot EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN** logging for the two index-sensitive refresh statements (restorePreserve UPDATE and updateGroups UPDATE+correlated-subquery), executed once per refresh, not per row

### Changed
- Dropped fix220's `synchronous=OFF` SQLite pragma experiment (Samsung S25 with fast UFS storage shows the bottleneck is not storage I/O but likely Dart/isolate round-trip overhead, and the durability risk isn't justified)
- Enhanced logging in `Sql.commitWriteBatched`: per-closure timing callback, slow-closure count summary

### Technical
- All changes are diagnostic/logging only; no behavior changes
- New symbols: `Sql.onClosureTimed` callback parameter; `Sql.logRefreshQueryPlans(sourceId)`
- New imports: `dart:io`, `utils.dart` in `xtream.dart`; `dart:io` in `settings_view.dart`
- UI: long-press "Export log file" tile now exports raw Xtream dumps (concatenated) for easier diagnostic collection on phones (separate from the normal log export)
- `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos` clean (2 pre-existing tolerated INFOs in settings_view.dart only)

### How to use
1. Enable debug logging in Settings
2. Refresh Emjay (and Aniel) — this generates `xtream_dump_*.json` files in the app directory
3. **TAP** "Export log file" to save the normal debug log (unchanged)
4. **LONG-PRESS** "Export log file" to export the raw source dumps concatenated into a single file (diagnostic)
5. Send both the log and the source dumps back — the raw payloads enable true apples-to-apples sandbox replay of the exact parse + insert workload
